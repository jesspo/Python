# R - Basic commands

## Filtering data from a Matrix

Install dplyr

```R
install.packages(dplyr)

library(dplyr)
```

Ex: you want to have only the values in column1 higher than 30 and in column2 higher than 8

```R
filter(data, data$column1 >30, data$column2 >8)
```

and you will obtain a new subset, only with the data which has those characteristics
